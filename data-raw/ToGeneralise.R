# Before ready4 can be used as a software framework for projects other than the ready4 model (www.ready4-dev.com) the following functions need to be edited:.
# get_badges_lup
# get_badge_urls
# get_cls_extensions
# get_source_code_urls
# make_code_releases_tbl
# make_dss_tb make_libraries_tb
# make_modules_pkgs_chr
# make_modules_tb
# make_subroutine_repos
# print_packages
# Also, to implement improved consented writing:
# write_new_credentials write_new_dirs write_prj_outp_dirs write_tb_to_csv write_to_delete_dirs write_to_dv_from_tbl write_to_dv_with_wait write_to_force_links_in write_to_publish_dv_ds write_to_trim_html
