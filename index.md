## Develop and Use Modular Health Economic Models

A template model module, tools to help find model modules derived from
this template and a programming syntax to use these modules in health
economic analyses. These elements are the foundation for a prototype
software framework for developing living and transferable models and
using those models in reproducible health economic analyses. The
software framework is extended by other R libraries. For detailed
documentation about the framework and how to use it visit
<https://www.ready4-dev.com/>. For a background to the methodological
issues that the framework is attempting to help solve, see Hamilton et
al. (2024) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-024-01378-8>.

To install a development version of this software, run the following
commands in your R console:

``` r
utils::install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("ready4-dev/ready4")
```
