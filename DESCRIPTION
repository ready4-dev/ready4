Description: A template model module, tools to help find model modules
    derived from this template and a programming syntax to use these
    modules in health economic analyses.  These elements are the
    foundation for a prototype software framework for developing living
    and transferable models and using those models in reproducible health
    economic analyses. The software framework is extended by other R
    libraries.  For detailed documentation about the framework and how to
    use it visit <https://www.ready4-dev.com/>. For a background to the
    methodological issues that the framework is attempting to help solve,
    see Hamilton et al. (2024) <doi:10.1007/s40273-024-01378-8>.
