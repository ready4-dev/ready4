Description: ready4 provides bare bones foundational elements (classes,
    generics, methods, functions) of a software framework for developing
    modular, open source computational models in R. The current version is
    optimised to support the collaborative development of economic models
    of the systems shaping young people's mental health.  The foundation
    provided by this package is extended by other R packages. For detailed
    documentation about the extended framework and models being developed
    with it see https://www.ready4-dev.com/. This development version of
    the ready4 package has been made available as part of the process of
    testing and documenting the package. If you have any questions, please
    contact the author (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).
